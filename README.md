## Roles
- Mahi - Front End
- Aiden - Front End
- Kiara - Database
- Joey - Database
- James - API
- Brooke - Project Manager
## Ideas/Tasks
### Frontend
- Aiden will make a basic concept for the website's UI/UX and post in the Frontend chat
- Both Aiden and Mahi will split up work for the frontend development based on the concept and any other ideas thrown out there by the team
### API
- James will work on the API development, and any other work necessary can be allocated to anyone willing, probably Kiara or Brooke, if available, of course
### Database
- If we need any database work done in retrospect, Joey or Kiara can handle it (ref mainly for non-database devs)
### Presentation
- Kiara mentioned she'd be able to take some initiative on the presentation
- Make sure we're all in the loop regarding the progress on that and who will be talking about what. After the main development is completed, might be good to have a meeting where we all talk about our presentation roles, since the assignment mentions collective participation in the presentation
## Rules
Try to stick these just for uniformity's sake, mainly
### Branching
- Make sure we branch off of the `master` branch and PR (pull request) any changes to files via those branches
### Documentation/Explanations
- Might be good to keep some kind of document that goes through any changes made and explains them so if another person needs to reference something that is a bit more esoteric they can understand it to some degree
- The document could be this README.md or another .md/.txt file we keep in the root
- If this is too much, we can always just make sure to add ample comments in any code just to explain things
- For the database, a quick document explaining the structure for quick reference may be good. Anyone with access or availability could complete this, since we should all be able to get to the structure via terminal/ssh
